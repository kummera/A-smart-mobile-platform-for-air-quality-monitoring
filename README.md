# A-Smart-Mobile-Platform-For-Air-Quality-Monitoring
#### Introduction:
  Air quality monitoring is a rising issue with the increased concentrations of aerosols in today's atmosphere. Portable, self-sufficient, air quality monitoring systems are now necessary to ensure that air quality in a variety of environments can be easily measured, monitored, and studied. With aerosols always present, and the possible harmful side effects they bring, it is important that we regulate these levels to ensure public safety. Large-scale air quality monitoring requires networked sensors that are low-cost and compact in size while also being accurate and appropriately sensitive.  With increasing availability of low-cost sensors, large-scale monitoring maybe possible if their measurement accuracy and sensitivity is established under field conditions. This is why a portable, low-cost, efficient air quality monitoring system is needed. The dynamics of urban particulate matter (PM) is complicated by the large number of PM micro-sources that are spatially and temporally non-uniformly distributed.  Any effort to understand this dynamics and make policies to improve air quality requires the identification of these micro-sources and their complete characterization.  Such an identification and characterization of PM sources is only possible if air quality monitoring is made at high enough spatial and temporal resolution. Particle concentrations are of special concern when they fall into the category of PM2.5, which is the mass concentration of particles that are less than or equal to the aerodynamic size of 2.5 microns. Certain levels of these particles can be detrimental to human health. These particles, and others like them, have the ability to infiltrate the lungs and cause damage because of their small size. They can cause irritation of the eyes, irregular heartbeat, lung congestion, asthma attacks, and heart attacks. Since these particles have the capability of being so dangerous to human health, it is essential to monitor the levels of these particles so that we can ensure that no one is at risk of any of these afflictions. This system will aid in monitoring all types of neighborhoods and environments, from a natrual environment to an urban setting. As part of this project, a network-ready platform that can house multiple sensors will be deployed in a pilot study to demonstrate the possibility of making large-scale measurements with commercial low-cost sensors.
